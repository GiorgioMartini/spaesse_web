# issues

* 2982: on Mobiles, long words are cut, it would be better if the font scales down little bit, of the container of the text holding it extends little bit
* 2988: The boxes (oranges and purples) are not equally in their width, they should align left and right borders
* 2989: Make the phone number clickable with `<a href="tel:1-847-555-5555">1-847-555-5555</a>`
* 2991: which graphics are missing here? Whats their real names/paths?
* 2992: Boxes needs to have more width (approx 90% of Mobile screen)
* 2993: Mobile - the Menu "Burger" button should be above the Word "Home" inside (!) the Menu
* 2994: Mobile - the Menu point AKTUELLES can be removed for now
* 2995: Mobile - why cant I click on LOGIN?
* 2996: Mobile - Use Cases - All of them link to HOTEL BREDENEY, but the both which arent HOTEL BREDENEY should link to their correct URL (`cms/de/kramer-schuhe` and `cms/de/nx-stage`)
* 2997: Mobile - Can the closing of the menu, after I clicked a Menu item, be delayed by ~200ms ?
